# Tabellio

##Introduction
This is the final project for CodeCore Developer Bootcamp that I attended from October to December 2015. 

##Concept
The project name, _Tabellio_, is a Latin word meaning messenger. This name has been chosen because of the main task of the web app: sending messages. However, the web app is somewhat different from a typical messaging system as it is not an instant messaging app. The core idea of the app is somewhat similar to that of a "time capsule"; that is, a user creates a message and set a recipient as usual however a specific date and location for the message could be determined as well. Subsequently, the recipient would receive a notification - rather than the message itself - indicating instructions for retrieving the message. The message could only be delivered if the recipient goes to the specified location at or after the specified time. The instructions would also include a unique "key" that would be used to access the message.
